\description{
Downloads, formulates and indexes BioticExplorer database.
}
\details{
Runs the \code{\link{downloadDatabase}} and \code{\link{indexDatabase}} functions. Be aware that running these functions requires access to the IMR intranet, reasonably fast internet and loads of memory. If the function crashes after the \code{\link{downloadDatabase}}, you can still run the \code{\link{indexDatabase}} to save the progress. If it crashes during \code{\link{downloadDatabase}}, you may have to start from scratch.
